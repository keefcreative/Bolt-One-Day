# 📋 Content Improvement Workflow Guide

## The Complete Workflow

### 🔄 What Happens at Each Step:

```
1. ANALYZE → 2. IMPROVE → 3. REVIEW → 4. IMPLEMENT
```

---

## Step 1: Analyze (What You Already Did)
```bash
npm run analyze
```
- **What it does**: Checks brand voice consistency
- **Uses**: Rule-based checking (NO AI)
- **Output**: Score report showing issues (44.8% average)

---

## Step 2: Generate Improvements ✨ NEW!
```bash
npm run improve
```
- **What it does**: Creates new, improved copy
- **Uses**: OpenAI Assistant (DWB-BrandVoice)
- **Process**:
  1. Finds low-scoring content (<80%)
  2. Sends each piece to your AI Assistant
  3. Generates brand-aligned improvements
  4. Creates side-by-side comparison

---

## Step 3: Review & Approve 👀
```bash
npm run review
```
Opens an interactive HTML interface showing:

### What You'll See:
- **Original Copy** (yellow box) vs **Improved Copy** (green box)
- **Side-by-side comparison** for easy review
- **Action buttons** for each improvement:
  - ✅ **Approve** - Mark for implementation
  - ✏️ **Edit** - Manually adjust the AI suggestion
  - ❌ **Reject** - Skip this change

### Example:
```
┌─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ ORIGINAL                │ IMPROVED                │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ "We deliver world-class │ "We create powerful     │
│ design solutions"       │ design that works"      │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
                [Edit] [Reject] [Approve]
```

---

## Step 4: Implement Changes
```bash
npm run implement
```
- **What it does**: Applies approved changes to actual files
- **Safety**: Creates automatic backup first
- **Updates**: Only changes what you approved

---

## 🎯 The Complete Flow

### Option A: Full Automation
```bash
npm run workflow:full
```
Runs all steps sequentially: analyze → improve → review

### Option B: Step by Step
```bash
npm run analyze        # Check current scores
npm run improve        # Generate AI improvements
npm run review         # Open review interface
# ... approve changes in browser ...
npm run implement      # Apply to website
```

## 💡 What Makes This Different

### Old Way (Just Analysis):
- Shows problems ❌
- Suggests general improvements 💭
- You write new copy manually ✍️

### New Way (Full Workflow):
- Shows problems ❌
- **AI writes actual new copy** ✨
- **You review side-by-side** 👀
- **One click to implement** 🚀
