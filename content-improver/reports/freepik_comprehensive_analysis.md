### 1. **Image Generation API**
```javascript
// Multiple AI Models Available
const models = {
  "flux-dev": "Same as your current Replicate",
  "hyperflux": "Enhanced Flux variant",
  "google-imagen-3": "Superior text rendering",
  "mystic": "Artistic styles",
  "gemini-2.5-flash": "NEW - Fast generation",
  "seedream": "Photorealistic",
  "classic-fast": "Quick drafts"
};

  icons: "UI/UX elements",
  templates: "Ready-made designs",
  mockups: "Device presentations",

```javascript
const editingCapabilities = {
  backgroundRemoval: "Instant cutouts",

## ðŸ¤– Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

### What is MCP?
MCP allows Freepik to integrate **directly into AI assistants** like Claude (me!), Cursor, and other AI tools.

```json
// Direct Integration with Claude
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-freepik": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", 
        "mcp-remote", 
        "https://api.freepik.com/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### What This Means:
1. **I could directly access** Freepik's entire library
2. **Search and generate** without leaving our conversation
3. **Automatic workflow** integration
4. **Real-time asset management**
