The challenge wasn't just design—it was creating genuine anticipation that translates to actual attendance. Previous corporate events had struggled with low response rates.",
  "solution": "We built excitement from the subject line down. 'You're invited!' with the promise of experiencing 'the roar of the Superbikes with Compello at Donington Park.' Clear event details, compelling motorsport imagery, and a CTA that made RSVP feel like the only logical response. Every element designed to drive action, not just admiration.",
