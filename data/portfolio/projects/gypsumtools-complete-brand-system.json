  "challenge": "GYPSUMTOOLS had a problem that goes beyond looks—their brand looked unprofessional. Inconsistent letter spacing, forgettable logo, sloppy collateral. When you're about to face customers in your store, looking credible isn't vanity. It's business survival. They needed a complete overhaul that would work across every touchpoint from email signatures to staff uniforms.",
  "solution": "We didn't just redesign—we rebuilt from the ground up. New logo maintaining their bold orange identity but with proper typography and distinction. Then we created the system that makes brands work: strategic brand book, professional email signatures for the whole team, corporate document headers, complete uniform designs, and social media assets optimized for real platforms. Every piece working together.",
