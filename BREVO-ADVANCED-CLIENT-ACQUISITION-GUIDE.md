## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 1.1 Exit-Intent Popups with Lead Magnets

#### **Brevo Implementation:**

**Step 1: Create Lead Magnet Landing Pages**
```javascript
// Add to app/layout.tsx for exit-intent detection
useEffect(() => {
  let mouseY = 0;
  
  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    mouseY = e.clientY;
  };
  
  const handleMouseLeave = (e) => {
    if (mouseY < 10) {
      // Trigger Brevo popup
      if (window.BrevoConversations) {
        window.BrevoConversations('openPopup', 'exit-intent');
      }
    }
  };
  
  document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
  document.addEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave);
  
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);
    document.removeEventListener('mouseleave', handleMouseLeave);
  };
}, []);
```

**Step 2: Brevo Form Configuration**

[Tell story about inconsistent branding/poor design]

This single issue was costing them an estimated £50k+ in lost revenue annually.

Here's how to spot if you have the same problem:

2. [Diagnostic point 2]  
3. [Diagnostic point 3]

If you recognized your business in any of these, don't worry - it's completely fixable.

Tomorrow I'll show you how [Similar Company] solved this exact issue and increased their leads by 300%.

Best,
Keith

### 1.3 Basic Lead Scoring Configuration

#### **Brevo Lead Scoring Setup:**
1. **Go to**: Brevo → Contacts → Lead Scoring
2. **Configure Scoring Rules**:

```json
{
  "leadScoringRules": [
    {
      "action": "downloaded lead magnet",
      "points": 15,
      "description": "Shows initial interest"
    },
    {
      "action": "opened 2+ emails in welcome series", 
      "points": 20,
      "description": "Engaged with nurture content"
    },
    {
      "action": "visited pricing page after email",
      "points": 25,
      "description": "Considering purchase"
    },
    {
      "action": "clicked 'book consultation' link",
      "points": 30,
      "description": "High purchase intent"
    },
    {
      "action": "started but didn't complete contact form",
      "points": 35,
      "description": "Hesitant but interested"
    },
    {
      "action": "enterprise email domain (.com, .co.uk, custom)",
      "points": 10,
      "description": "Professional contact"
    },
    {
      "action": "mentioned budget/timeline in chat or form",
      "points": 40,
      "description": "Sales-ready indicator"
    }
  ],
  "autoQualification": {
    "threshold": 75,
    "action": "move to 'Sales Ready' list + notify team"
  }
}
```

### 1.4 Abandoned Form Recovery

#### **Tracking Implementation:**
```javascript
// Add to contact form component
const trackFormAbandonment = () => {
  let formStarted = false;
  let abandonmentTimer;

  // Track when user starts typing
  const inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input, textarea');
  inputs.forEach(input => {
    input.addEventListener('focus', () => {
      if (!formStarted) {
        formStarted = true;
        // Set abandonment timer
        abandonmentTimer = setTimeout(() => {
          // Trigger Brevo abandonment tracking
          if (window.BrevoConversations) {
            window.BrevoConversations('trackEvent', 'form_abandoned', {
              form: 'contact',
              timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
            });
          }
        }, 300000); // 5 minutes
      }
    });
  });

  // Clear timer on form submission
  document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', () => {
    clearTimeout(abandonmentTimer);
  });
};
```

#### **Brevo Workflow:**
```json
{
  "abandonedFormWorkflow": {
    "trigger": "form_abandoned event tracked",
    "workflow": [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "action": "wait",
        "duration": "1 hour"
      },
      {
        "step": 2,
        "action": "sendEmail", 
        "template": "form-abandonment-gentle",
        "subject": "Quick question - what held you back?",
        "condition": "if email captured during form start"
      },
      {
        "step": 3,
        "action": "wait",
        "duration": "1 day"
      },
      {
        "step": 4,
        "action": "sendEmail",
        "template": "form-abandonment-help",
        "subject": "We're here to help - no pressure"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: Behavioral Automation

### 2.1 Page-Specific Email Sequences

#### **Implementation Strategy:**
Use Brevo's website tracking to trigger different email sequences based on page behavior.

#### **Brevo Tracking Code Enhancement:**
```javascript
// Add to app/layout.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (window.BrevoConversations) {
    // Track page views with context
    const trackPageView = (page) => {
      window.BrevoConversations('trackEvent', 'page_view', {
        page: page,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        url: window.location.href
      });
    };

    // Page-specific tracking
    const currentPath = window.location.pathname;
    
    if (currentPath.includes('pricing')) {
      trackPageView('pricing');
      // Start pricing sequence after 30 seconds
      setTimeout(() => {
        window.BrevoConversations('trackEvent', 'pricing_page_engaged');
      }, 30000);
    } else if (currentPath.includes('portfolio')) {
      trackPageView('portfolio');
      // Track time on portfolio
      let portfolioTime = 0;
      const portfolioTimer = setInterval(() => {
        portfolioTime += 10;
        if (portfolioTime >= 120) { // 2 minutes
          window.BrevoConversations('trackEvent', 'portfolio_highly_engaged');
          clearInterval(portfolioTimer);
        }
      }, 10000);
    } else if (currentPath.includes('design-for-good')) {
      trackPageView('design_for_good');
    }
  }
}, []);
```

#### **Email Sequences by Page:**

**Pricing Page Sequence:**
```json
{
  "pricingPageSequence": {
    "trigger": "visited pricing page + not yet subscriber",
    "emails": [
      {
        "delay": "1 hour",
        "subject": "Questions about our design packages?",
        "template": "pricing-questions",
        "content": "I noticed you were checking out our pricing. Most clients have questions about which package fits their needs..."
      },
      {
        "delay": "2 days", 
        "subject": "How [Similar Client] chose the right design package",
        "template": "pricing-case-study",
        "content": "[Case study of client with similar business size/industry]"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2.2 SMS Integration for High-Value Leads

#### **Brevo SMS Setup:**
1. **Go to**: Brevo → SMS → Settings
2. **Add SMS Credits** to your account
3. **Configure Sender ID**: "DesignWorks" or your preferred name
4. **Set up Opt-in Compliance**: GDPR-compliant opt-in checkbox

#### **High-Value SMS Triggers:**
```json
{
  "smsWorkflows": [
    {
      "name": "High-Intent Lead SMS",
      "trigger": "lead score > 75 OR mentioned budget in chat",
      "workflow": [
        {
          "step": 1,
          "action": "sendSMS",
          "message": "Hi {FIRSTNAME}, I'm Keith from DesignWorks. Saw you're interested in our design services - free for a quick 5-min chat? 📞",
          "delay": "15 minutes",
          "condition": "phone number exists + SMS opt-in"
        },
        {
          "step": 2,
          "action": "wait",
          "duration": "4 hours"
        },
        {
          "step": 3,
          "action": "sendSMS", 
          "message": "No pressure at all! If timing isn't right now, just reply LATER and I'll check back in a few weeks. Otherwise, here's my calendar: meet.brevo.com/designworksbureau",
          "condition": "no response to first SMS"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2.3 Progressive Profiling Implementation

#### **Strategy:**
Gradually collect information across multiple interactions instead of overwhelming with a long form.

#### **Progressive Form Fields:**
```json
{
  "progressiveProfilingStages": {
    "stage1_leadMagnet": {
      "fields": ["email", "firstName"],
      "goal": "minimal friction for initial capture"
    },
    "stage2_emailEngagement": {
      "fields": ["company", "industry"], 
      "trigger": "opened 2+ emails",
      "method": "inline email survey or follow-up form"
    },
    "stage3_highEngagement": {
      "fields": ["projectType", "timeline", "budgetRange"],
      "trigger": "visited pricing 2+ times",
      "method": "chat conversation or consultation booking form"
    },
    "stage4_salesReady": {
      "fields": ["phone", "projectDetails", "decisionMakers"],
      "trigger": "books consultation",
      "method": "meeting preparation form"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Brevo Implementation:**
Create multiple forms with conditional logic:

1. **Form 1: Lead Magnet** (Email + Name only)
2. **Form 2: Company Details** (Triggered by email engagement)
3. **Form 3: Project Details** (Triggered by high intent signals)

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

        "action": "sendEmail",
        "template": "meeting-confirmation-enhanced",
        "subject": "Meeting confirmed! Here's how to prepare (+ portfolio preview)",
        "delay": "5 minutes",
        "content": "Thanks for booking! To make our 30 minutes super valuable, I've attached a preview of relevant portfolio pieces..."
      },
      {
        "step": 2,

      },
      {
        "step": 3,
        "action": "sendSMS",
        "message": "Hi {FIRSTNAME}, looking forward to our chat in 1 hour! Zoom link: [MEETING_LINK]",
        "delay": "1 hour before meeting",

   {% endif %}
   ```

#### **Email 2: Problem Agitation**
```html
Subject: This mistake cost [Company] £50k in lost revenue

Hi {{contact.FIRSTNAME}},

Yesterday I was reviewing a potential client's current website, and within 30 seconds I spotted the issue that was costing them clients...

Inconsistent branding across their touchpoints.

• Their website looked professional
• Their email signatures were outdated  
• Their social media was completely off-brand
• Their business cards looked like a different company entirely

The result? Prospects didn't trust them enough to move forward.

After we fixed their brand consistency, their conversion rate increased by 47% in 3 months. That represented over £50k in additional revenue.

Here's how to spot if you have the same problem:

1. Put your website, business card, and latest social post side by side
2. Ask: "Would someone immediately know these are the same company?"
3. Check if your colors, fonts, and messaging tone match

If you spotted inconsistencies, don't worry - this is completely fixable.

Tomorrow I'll show you exactly how [Similar Company] solved this issue...

Best,
Keith

P.S. Want me to take a 2-minute look at your current brand consistency? Just reply with your website URL - no charge, no sales pitch.

### Behavioral Trigger Templates

#### **Pricing Page Visitor Email**
```html
Subject: Questions about our design packages?

Hi {{contact.FIRSTNAME}},

I noticed you were checking out our pricing page earlier. 

Most business owners have questions about which package makes sense for their situation, so I wanted to reach out personally.

The most common questions I get:

❓ "What's the difference between Essential and Professional?"
❓ "How do you handle rush projects?"  
❓ "Can we pause the subscription if needed?"
❓ "What if we need something not listed?"

Good news: I have answers to all of these (and probably whatever else you're wondering).

Want to jump on a quick 15-minute call? No sales pitch - just straight answers to help you make the right decision.

[BOOK A QUICK CALL]

Or just reply with your questions and I'll answer by email.

Best,
Keith
