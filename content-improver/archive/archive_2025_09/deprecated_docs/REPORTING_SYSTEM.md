## Integration with CI/CD

The system can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action
- name: Analyze Brand Voice
  run: |
    cd "Content Script"
    npm install
    npm run analyze:md
    
- name: Upload Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
  with:
    name: brand-voice-report
    path: Content Script/reports/analysis.md
```

## Troubleshooting

### Low Scores
If you see very low scores (< 10%), this typically means:
1. Content uses corporate jargon
2. Missing signature brand phrases
3. Lack of power words in CTAs
4. Inconsistent tone across files

### No Changes Found
If preview shows no changes, either:
1. Content already meets brand voice standards
2. Threshold is set too low (default is 80%)
3. File has minimal text content

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Analysis**: Run weekly to maintain consistency
2. **Team Training**: Share reports with content creators
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Update brand_voice_config.json as voice evolves
4. **Metrics Tracking**: Monitor score improvements over time
