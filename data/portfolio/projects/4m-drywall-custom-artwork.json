  "challenge": "The brief was clear: recreate construction imagery at exactly 184mm x 130mm. But here's the thing—good design isn't just about following instructions. 4M DRYWALL's brand colors needed integration, their messaging needed to shine, and the final piece needed to work for their residential market focus. Precision plus purpose, delivered under tight technical constraints.",
  "solution": "We analyzed the reference, then made it theirs. Swapped yellow for their signature blue steel. Designed a clean header with proper logo placement. Integrated their core message about high-quality drylining for residential markets. Every element served both the technical brief and their brand story. That's how custom work should function—meeting specs while building brand.",
