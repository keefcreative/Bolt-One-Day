  "challenge": "Here's a common problem: Level 5's catalogue was designed for print when most customers read it digitally. Small text that looked fine on paper became unreadable at 100% screen scale. Two-page spreads that worked in print created terrible user experience on devices. They needed digital-first thinking, not print-first compromise.",
  "solution": "Complete restructure prioritizing how people actually use catalogues today. Significantly increased body text font size for comfortable reading at 100% digital scale. Split two-page spreads into single pages for natural digital navigation. Added branded footer elements for consistent company recognition. Every change focused on user experience without sacrificing professionalism.",
