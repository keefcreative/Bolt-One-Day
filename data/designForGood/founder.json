      "For years, we've powered brands to scale with design. But, we've always known deep inside that this game-changing force — the sort that forges trust, inspires action, and shifts views — should be in the hands of those tackling major global issues.",
      "That sparked the birth of the Design for Good Initiative.",
      "This is our offer to non-profits — designed to equip charities and social enterprises with top-notch design support, minus the hefty agency fees. It's straightforward, tailored to your cause, and easy on the wallet.",
      "We stand by the power of great design to move people. It can stir emotions, shift perspectives, and motivate donations. Properly harnessed, it doesn't just improve a brand — it amplifies a cause.",
      "Your team may be lean. You may be juggling more roles than you should. Yet, your message can still pack a punch. We're here to ensure your mission shines with the boldness, clarity, and visual impact it truly deserves."
