      "We've spent years helping brands grow through the power of design. But deep down, we've always felt that this same creative force — the kind that shapes perceptions, builds trust, and inspires action — should be just as available to the people solving the world's biggest challenges.",
      "That's what led us to create the Design for Good Initiative.",
      "This is our nonprofit-first service — built to give charities and social enterprises access to thoughtful, high-quality design support without the usual agency price tag. It's simple, affordable, and built around your mission.",
      "We believe good design moves people. It can open hearts, open minds, and open wallets. And when used well, it doesn't just elevate a brand — it grows a movement.",
      "You might have a small team. You might be wearing too many hats. But that doesn't mean your message should look small. We're here to make sure your mission shows up with the strength, clarity, and visual confidence it deserves."
