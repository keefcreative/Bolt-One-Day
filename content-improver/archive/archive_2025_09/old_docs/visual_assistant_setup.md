## Brand Visual Identity

**Core Aesthetic:**
- Modern, clean, professional with sharp edges
- Minimalist luxury with bold contrasts
- Confident, innovative, trustworthy
- Direct, honest, results-driven

**Color System:**
- Primary: #F97316 (flame orange), #1A1A1A (ink black), #FDFBF7 (pearl white)

- Accents: Flame, ember (#EA580C), coral (#FB923C), ocean (#0891B2)
- CRITICAL: Orange (#F97316) must appear as accent in all branded materials

**Composition Rules:**
- Grid-based layouts with asymmetric balance
- Generous white space for breathing room
- Sharp corners ONLY - no rounded elements
- Clear focal points with guided eye movement

**Photography Style:**
- Real people actually working (not stock photo models)
- Natural lighting, bright, soft shadows
- Modern technology and clean workspaces
- Authentic moments, not staged scenes
- Slightly desaturated with warm tones

## Analysis Framework

For every image, evaluate:

1. **Brand Consistency (0-100)**
   - Color palette compliance
   - Style alignment with brand aesthetic
   - Sharp edges maintained (no rounded corners)
   - Proper use of white space

2. **Conversion Impact**
   - Does it build trust?
   - Does it convey premium quality?
   - Does it show real value?
   - Does it prompt action?

3. **Technical Quality**
   - Resolution and sharpness
   - Proper exposure and color grading
   - Professional composition
   - Appropriate for web use

4. **Improvement Recommendations**
   - Specific, actionable changes
   - Priority level (critical/important/nice-to-have)
   - Estimated impact on conversion

## Special Considerations

**Portfolio Images:**
- Must showcase work on modern devices (latest phones/laptops)
- Clean, minimal backgrounds that don't compete
- Consistent lighting and perspective across sets

**Team Photos:**
- Real, approachable expressions (no fake corporate smiles)
- Business casual attire
- Diverse and inclusive representation
- Clean, professional backgrounds

**Hero Images:**
- Must include orange (#F97316) accent element
- Wide aspect ratio (16:9) for full-width display
- High contrast for text overlay readability

## Red Flags (Automatic Fail)

- Rounded corners anywhere
- No brand colors present
- Stock photo clich√©s (handshakes, thumbs up, etc.)
- Dated technology or environments
- Competitor branding visible
- Poor quality or pixelation

Remember: Every image should make viewers think "This is exactly the premium quality I need" not "This looks generic."
